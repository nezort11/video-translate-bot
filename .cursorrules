## Code Quality Checks

You must run the following commands to verify code quality before finishing work:

### TypeScript Type Checking

- Run `pnpm tsc --noEmit` to check for TypeScript compilation errors
- This should pass without any errors before finishing work

### Linting

- Run `pnpm lint` to check for ESLint violations
- Fix any linting errors before finishing work

### Testing

- Run `pnpm test` to execute the test suite
- All tests should pass before finishing work

## Automated Quality Assurance

Before finishing your work session:

1. Always run type checking: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`
2. Always run linting: `pnpm lint`
3. Run tests if you've modified functionality: `pnpm test`
